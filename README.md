## Challen Dragonfly Projection

"Challen Dragonfly Projection", I made this a few years ago, Inspired by the Waterman butterfly projection; and it's never left my computer since. It folds to form a cuboctahedron. I'd love someone to do something more with this. Made it using Flexify 2 plugin in Photoshop.
